# 🧪 S1.06 - Java Generics (Level 2)

## 📄 Description - Exercise Instructions

This repository contains the resolution of Level 2 Java Generics exercises.

### Exercise 1
Modify the previous generic method so that **one of the three arguments is not generic**.  
The goal is to demonstrate that a method can mix fixed and generic types.

### Exercise 2
Modify the previous method so that the generic arguments are accepted as a **list of variable-length arguments** (varargs).  
This allows passing any number and combination of types to the method.

These exercises build on the previous level and demonstrate more flexible and dynamic use of Java generics.
